Intro
=====

The MapntikTileServer is a time sensitve mapnik based tile server for
`OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ and `Open Historical Data Map <http://www.ohdm.net/>`_.
Writte in python with the web framework `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ and
the offical `OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_  stylesheets.

What is a Tile?
---------------

A tile is a part of a map. On each zoom level, the map is split into zoom^4 map parts (tiles).

What is a Tile server?
----------------------

A Tile Server is a web service which handle user request over the ``HTTP`` / ``HTTPS``
protcol. A user request is define over the reuqest URL. As response get the user
a single tile of a map.

There are some JavaScript libaries, which can handle tile server request and
merge each tile to a map. The two most common libaries are `Leaflet <https://leafletjs.com/>`_
and `OpenLayers <https://openlayers.org/>`_.

What is the different of the MapntikTileServer vs other Tile-Servers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The main diffence is, that this tile server can handle time request. So you
can request a map of a specific date. To handle date specific request,
the project `openstreetmap-carto <https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/>`_
was use as base. `Openstreetmap-carto <https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/>`_
is the github repository for the stylesheets, which are used on https://openstreetmap.org/.
To add time sensitive request, the project was forked `forked <https://github.com/linuxluigi/openstreetmap-carto/>`_
and the ``project.mml`` file was modified to make ``SQL`` request for a specific day.

On the diagram below, there is the workflow of the MapntikTileServer descipted.

Cookiecutter Django
-------------------

The project was created with
`Cookiecutter Django <https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django>`_ and
build up with docker. So if you unsure how to use this MapntikTileServer,
read the the `Cookiecutter Django Docs <https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
for help.

For faster developing and better testing, this project use Docker and Docker-Compose
to build and run the MapntikTileServer.

Celery Task Queue
-----------------

For the production setup, the tile are produce in a `Celery-Task-Queue <https://celeryproject.org/>`_.
Celery is a python task queue, which run in extra threads / container for more
performence. For every URL of a tile, which is not already in the cache, there
will be triggered a new task on the queue.

Every celery container have mutiple threads, where it can process tile request. To scale
up the production you can use with docker::

   $ docker-compose -f production.yml scale celeryworker=2

But be careful how many containers you scale up to, do not create more
celery threads on one machine than there are CPU cores. So if you host has
8 core, scale up to max of 2 workers.
